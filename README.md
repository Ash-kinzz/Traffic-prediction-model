**Traffic Prediction Model using Random Forest**
This repository contains the code and resources for a traffic prediction model built using the Random Forest algorithm.

**Project Overview**
This project aims to develop a model that can predict future traffic conditions based on historical traffic data and other relevant features. This model can be used for various applications, such as:

1. Improving traffic management systems: By predicting traffic congestion, authorities can take proactive measures to alleviate it.
2. Route optimization for navigation apps: Users can be directed to routes with less traffic based on predicted conditions.
3. Personal trip planning: Individuals can use the model to plan trips during times with less expected traffic congestion.

**Model Implementation**
This project utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for traffic prediction. Random Forest is a machine learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees, leading to a more robust and accurate prediction model.

Data
The project uses traffic.csv from kaggle containing historical traffic data. The data includes features like:

Time
Date	
Day of the week	
CarCount	BikeCount	BusCount TruckCount
Traffic Situation

**Usage**
1. Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python and required libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas) installed.
2. Data Preparation: Download the provided dataset (or use your own) and pre-process it according to the provided scripts (if applicable).
3. Model Training: Run the train_model.py script to train the Random Forest model on the prepared data.
4. Prediction: Use the trained model (model.pkl) to predict traffic conditions for future timeframes using the predict_traffic.py script.
